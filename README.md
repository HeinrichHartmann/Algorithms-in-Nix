# Algorithms in Nix

This repository contains a few programming etudes, to explore the nix language.

Featured Algorithms include:

* Fibbonacci Sequence
* Euklidean Algorithm (compute `gcd(x,y)`)
* Extended Euklidean Algorithm (compute `a,b` so that `ax+by=gcd(x,y)`)
* Erathostenes Prime Number Sieve
* Sorting Algorithms (Quicksort, Mergesort, Bubblesort)

## Usage

```
make test
```

Depends on `make` and `nix` being available.
